# Hidden Div Initially Visible Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the initial display style of a div element in HTML. The div is supposed to be hidden initially, but it appears visible due to an oversight in the code.

## Bug Description

The `div` element with the id "myDiv" should be hidden by default. However, due to a missing or incorrect initial display style, it is initially visible.  This can lead to unexpected visual layout issues.

## Solution

The solution involves setting the `display` style property of the div to `none` in the HTML, ensuring it is hidden upon initial page load. The corrected HTML sets the initial display style to `none`.
